# GalaxyZooCNN
Convolutional Neural Network for Galaxy Zoo Classification Task.

Repository includes MATLAB preprocessing for Blob Detection and Removal, Train/Test sorting for PyTorch Dataloader formatting, and a from-scratch 'Deep' CNN for Image Classification. CNN is initialized with Random Weights with a Cross Entropy Loss function and Stochastic Gradient Decent with Momentum.
